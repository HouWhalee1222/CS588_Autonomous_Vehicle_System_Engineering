# Description
This project involves using computer vision and machine learning techniques to accurately identify and classify different types of objects in the environment, such as **stop signs**, **pedestrians**, and **vehicles**. 

The project simulates the real-world scenario of the vehicle. At first, the vehicle moves forward with some speed. When it gets close and encounters the stop sign/pedestrians/other cars, the vehicle will brake and stop for a while, waiting for the signal to disappear (people pass across the road or the car moves along the intersection). When the vehicle can no longer detect the signal, it will resume moving forward with the previous speed.

Overall, this is a practical and interesting project. The project combines the object detection, vehicle sensor, and pid speed control techniques. It makes the vehicle really "autonomous".


## Steps
Open the 1st terminal, launch the joystick controller.
```
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch basic_launch gem_dbw_joystick.launch
```

Open the 2nd terminal, launch the basic sensors.
```
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch basic_launch gem_sensor_init.launch
```

Open the 3rd terminal
```
source devel/setup.bash
rosrun [PackageName] detect.py
```
